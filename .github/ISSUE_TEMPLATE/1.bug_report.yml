        Any extra information that might help us investigate. For example, where are you deploying your application (Vercel, Docker, other platform)? Is it only reproducible on that platform, or locally too? Is the issue only happening in a specific browser? etc.

        I tested my reproduction against different canary releases, and the first one that introduced the bug was "15.0.0-canary.148", since reverting to "15.0.0-canary.147" works.

        or

        I am hosting via Docker with the recommended `output: "standalone"` option, and if I remove that option or try a different hosting option, I cannot reproduce the same issue.
