## How to download files

Files are attached to model releases. You can download files from a release in one of two ways - by either finding the
release in the `Releases` tab and clicking the file download link:

<Box sx={{ maxWidth: '75%', margin: 'auto' }}>
  <Image alt='release in releases tab with attached, clickable file download link' src={releases} />
</Box>

or alternatively, visiting the page for a specific release and clicking the file download link:

<Box sx={{ maxWidth: '75%', margin: 'auto' }}>
  <Image alt='view of specific release with the clickable file download link' src={release} />
</Box>

export default ({ children }) => <DocsWrapper>{children}</DocsWrapper>
