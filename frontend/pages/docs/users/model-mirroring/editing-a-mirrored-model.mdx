# Editing a mirrored model

As the information in the source model is a source of truth, it will be in a read-only state. That means that another
mechanism has been provided in order to append additional information to a mirrored model.

<Box sx={{ maxWidth: '75%', margin: 'auto' }}>
  <Image alt='access request schema selection' src={editMirroredModel} />
</Box>

Instead of an "Edit" button, you will instead see the "Add additional information" button. This will change the input to
look like:

<Box sx={{ maxWidth: '75%', margin: 'auto' }}>
  <Image alt='access request schema selection' src={editMirroredModelForm} />
</Box>

It is important to the note that the format of the additional information for each question will be the same as the
original question. For example, if the original question is rich text, the additional question will be rich text.

Once an answer to the question has been filled out and saved, it will be displayed under the source answer. This allows
mirrored models to have additional context if needed, whilst still retaining the source of truth from the source model.

<Box sx={{ maxWidth: '40%', margin: 'auto' }}>
  <Image alt='access request schema selection' src={editMirroredModelResult} />
</Box>

export default ({ children }) => <DocsWrapper>{children}</DocsWrapper>
