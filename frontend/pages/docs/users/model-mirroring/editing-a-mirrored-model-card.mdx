# Editing a mirrored model card

Mirrored models are read-only with respect to information originating from the source model. This ensures the source
model remains the authoritative version.

You cannot directly edit source content in a mirrored model, however, you can add additional local information to
provide context that is specific to your environment or use case.

<Box sx={{ maxWidth: '75%', margin: 'auto' }}>
  <Image alt='access request schema selection' src={editMirroredModel} />
</Box>

## Adding additional information

Instead of an "Edit" button, mirrored models display an "Add additional information" button. Selecting this option
allows you to add local responses alongside the source content:

<Box sx={{ maxWidth: '75%', margin: 'auto' }}>
  <Image alt='access request schema selection' src={editMirroredModelForm} />
</Box>

Key points:

- Additional information does not overwrite source data
- The input type matches the original question
  - Rich text -> rich text
  - Number -> number
  - Structured input -> structured input
- Validation rules remain the same as the source question

## How additional information is displayed

Once saved, your additional information is shown beneath the source answer. This makes it clear which content originates
from the source model and which content is locally added.

<Box sx={{ maxWidth: '40%', margin: 'auto' }}>
  <Image alt='access request schema selection' src={editMirroredModelResult} />
</Box>

Additional information can be updated at any time and will persist across future synchronisations when the source model
is re-exported.

export default ({ children }) => <DocsWrapper>{children}</DocsWrapper>
