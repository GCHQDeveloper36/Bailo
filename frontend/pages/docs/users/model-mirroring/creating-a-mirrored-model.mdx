</Box>

After creating a mirrored model, copy the ID from the source model into the `Source Model ID` field:

<Box sx={{ maxWidth: '75%', margin: 'auto' }}>
  <Image alt='access request schema selection' src={mirrorCreateFormImage} />
</Box>

<Box sx={{ maxWidth: '75%', margin: 'auto' }}>
  <Image alt='access request schema selection' src={mirrorSettingsFormImage} />
</Box>
