# Creating a mirrored model

## What are Mirrored Models

Model mirroring is a system that allows users to make a copy of a model that can be used either within a single instance
of Bailo, or in another instance that is hosted by the same organisation.

In order to maintain a source of truth, users are unable to change the the source content of the model as it is a
read-only state. There is the option to add additional information inside the mirrored model, however.

## How to create a Mirrored Model

If model mirroring is enabled, users will be able to select create a mirrored model on the same model creation page:

<Box sx={{ maxWidth: '75%', margin: 'auto' }}>
  <Image alt='access request schema selection' src={mirrorCreateImage} />
</Box>

After creating a mirrored model, copy the ID from the source model into the `Source Model ID` field:

<Box sx={{ maxWidth: '75%', margin: 'auto' }}>
  <Image alt='access request schema selection' src={mirrorCreateFormImage} />
</Box>

After the mirrored model has been created, you will need to request a mirror inside the source model's settings:

<Box sx={{ maxWidth: '75%', margin: 'auto' }}>
  <Image alt='access request schema selection' src={mirrorSettingsFormImage} />
</Box>

export default ({ children }) => <DocsWrapper>{children}</DocsWrapper>
