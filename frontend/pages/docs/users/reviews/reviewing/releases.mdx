## **Release**

When reviewing a release, there will be a message in the **_Release Reviews_** tab, on the **_Review_** page, that will
state who needs to review the release.

<Box sx={{ maxWidth: '75%', margin: 'auto' }}>
  <Image alt='open release reviews page with three a list of unreviewed releases' src={bailoReviewPage} />
</Box>

Click on the release that applies to your role and this will take you to the **_Releases_** page. On the banner there is
a **_REVIEW_** button, where you can start your review.

<Box sx={{ maxWidth: '75%', margin: 'auto' }}>

</Box>

You have the option of approving or requesting changes.
